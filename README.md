# ðŸ§  Animal Extinction Predictor using Random Forest & Widgets

This Jupyter Notebook provides an interactive dashboard that allows users to select an animal species and a year, then predict:
- Whether the animal is endangered at that time,
- And project a **potential extinction year** based on model predictions and declining birth/death rates.
