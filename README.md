# ðŸ§  Animal Extinction Predictor using Random Forest & Widgets

This Jupyter Notebook provides an interactive dashboard that allows users to select an animal species and a year, then predict:
- Whether the animal is endangered at that time,
- And project a **potential extinction year** based on model predictions and declining birth/death rates.

##ðŸ§¾ Project Overview

The model simulates birth and death rates for various animal species from 2000 to 2025, and then predicts whether a species is endangered using a Random Forest classifier.

It uses `ipywidgets` for interactivity and includes:
- Live prediction of endangered status
- Future simulation to estimate extinction year (if any)
- Visual trend plots for population indices
